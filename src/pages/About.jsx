                Hey there...
            I’m Shahanwaz aka Sameer Sheikh, a passionate tech explorer on a quest to transform ideas into reality. Currently, I serve as a co-founder of two startups in their building phase, where I lead efforts in research and development, driving innovation and shaping the future of our projects. In addition, I am an R&D executive at Rubi Club, where I collaborate with a talented team to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance user experiences.

                As a Web3 enthusiast, I’m particularly excited about the potential of blockchain and decentralized technologies, aiming to integrate these advancements into our startups. My solid grip on the MERN stack and Java DSA empowers me to craft innovative web solutions that resonate with users. I also contribute to the tech team at the MLSA Rungta Club, where I engage with like-minded individuals to foster a community of learning and growth.

                My journey through the realms of React.js, JavaScript, and Python fuels my desire to tackle complex challenges head-on. Beyond coding, I thrive in the dynamic worlds of social media and marketing, blending creativity with strategy. Eager to dive into internship opportunities, I’m ready to contribute my skills and passion to projects that make a difference. Let’s connect and create something extraordinary!
